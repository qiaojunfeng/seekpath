          is the first vector)

          with the kpoints and the respective labels.
          For each segment, the two endpoints are always included, 
          independently of the length.
        - explicit_kpoints_linearcoord: array of floats, giving the 
          coordinate at which to plot the corresponding point.
        - segments: a list of length-2 tuples, with the start and end index
          of each segment. **Note**! The indices are supposed to be used as 
          follows: the labels for the i-th segment are given by::

            segment_indices = segments[i]
            segment_points = explicit_kpoints.get_kpoints[slice(*segment_indices)]

          This means, in particular, that if you want the label of the start
          and end points, you should do::

            start_point = explicit_kpoints.get_kpoints[segment_indices[0]]
            stop_point = explicit_kpoints.get_kpoints[segment_indices[1]-1]

          that the point was calculated only once, and it belongs to both 
          paths. Instead, if segments[i-1][1] == segments[i][0], then
          this is a 'break' point in the path (e.g., segments[i-1][1] is the
          X point, and segments[i][0] is the R point, and typically in a 
          graphical representation they are shown at the same coordinate,
